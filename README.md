# docflow-core
> Document processing system

This repository contains the source code for the Processing Server (Node.js) and Web Application (React) for a document processing system. The Processing Server handels document types and layouts, passing them through to OCR services. The web app is a dashboard for administrators to set up destinations for different file types and to define layouts. The Server interacts with a seperate client app for Windows Desktop that is developed seperately as [si-docflow-windows](https://github.com/kanitakadusic/si-docflow-windows).

## How To Use ‚öôÔ∏è

Prerequisite - [**Node.js + npm**](https://nodejs.org/en) & [**Git**](https://git-scm.com/)

```
# Clone this repo:
$ git clone https://github.com/HarisMalisevic/si-docflow-core.git

# After cloning is done, go into the project directory with
$ cd si-dockflow-core

# Install npm dependencies with
$ npm run dependencies

# Build project
$ npm run build
```

The previous two commands are shortcuts for longer commands.
For the build command, it runs ```cd backend && npm run build && cd ../frontend && npm run build```.
Other shortcuts like this one are defined in ```package.json``` files under ```"scripts"```.

## How to start?

1. After building the app, navigate to the project root folder ```/si-docflow-core```.
2. Start the web app and server with: ```npm run start```

This will make a local server on http://localhost:5000/.
